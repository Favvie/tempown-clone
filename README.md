# TempOwn Clone

TempOwn is an organization that aims to provide people with the opportunity to own equipments that they typically cannot pay full price for, for a short period of time.
This project is a recreation of the homepage and enterprise page of the TempOwn website, mainly to exercise my skills in React and Tailwind CSS.
You can check out the hosted version here: https://tempown-clone.vercel.app
